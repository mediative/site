# A post header

Some example text to get you started:

 - Remember to change the `title` and `author` in the frontmatter above.
 - See the README file for how to add your author information.
 - Post image(s) should be added in `static/images`. An immersive image
   can be configured in the frontmatter.

```scala
val code = "example"
```
